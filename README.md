## TestFlows Use

### How it works?

Creating a new issue you are requesting to be a verified client for Filecoin and assign datacap to your address.  As verified client you could get better deals from miners as you will be considered trustable. For now we won’t assign more datacap for an already verified client, so if you consume all datacap you must start the process again with a different address

### Why do I need to provide so much information?

We need to check your identity and the purpose of your request. The more datacap you are requesting the more info we need.

### Can you explain to me the steps of this process?

First you have to create a new issue filling the info. You can also include additional information you think could be useful for us. But be aware that this issue will be public so don’t include sensitive information 

You will need to have a GitHub user to open an issue. The activity of your GitHub account also will help us to get an idea of who you are.

This new issue will be assigned to a verifier, who will check the info you provided us. If your are requesting a big figure of datacap, or the info you provided is not clear enough, the verifier could ask you to provide additional information.

The verifier will comment on the issue to ask for this info. You will be notified on the email address associated with your GitHub address.

Once the verifier can check that you are a trusted person or company, he/she will assign you the requested datacap. The verifier will provide you a way to check the status of your data cap’s allocation
